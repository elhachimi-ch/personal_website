   abstract = {Optimizing traditional Open-Channel Irrigation Systems (OCIS) is crucial for enhancing water sustainability and food security in water-scarce regions. OCIS remains widely used in many countries but receives less research attention in optimization studies compared to the rapid advancements in precision agriculture, which leverage new technologies such as artificial intelligence, remote sensing, drones, and the internet of things. Here, this study aims to optimize Water Use Efficiency (WUE) in the context of OCIS by proposing a framework for an adaptive spatiotemporal distribution of sowing dates. The framework consists of an intelligent agent interacting with a Digital Twin (DT). R3 district, an irrigated area within the Tensift basin in Morocco was used as a study site. Agrometeorological data from an automatic weather station installed in R3 district feeds the DT. This latter operates currently as a Digital Model with no bidirectional data integration, and comprises a module based on the AquaCrop model to simulate crop growth, development, and yield, and another module using graph theory to simulate the OCIS. The study evaluates genetic algorithms (GAs), an evolutionary optimization technique, versus a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent for recommending the adaptive spatiotemporal distribution of sowing dates. The objective function is formulated as a constrained maximization of a Lagrangian function representing WUE, subject to the constraints imposed by the OCIS. The DDPG agent was trained for 1000 epochs, while GA ran for 100 generations. Results showed that the DDPG agent effectively learned the environment's dynamics through interactions with the R3 DT, as evidenced by increasing trend in the reward signals. However, GAs showed prolonged stagnation at multiple plateaus suggesting that GAs were unable to escape suboptimal solutions. In terms of training time, GAs take the longest. Additionally, comparing a same-day sowing date scenario to the adaptive sowing dates scenario recommended by the DDPG agent revealed a 4.69% increase in the total crop yield with WUE of 1.95 while adhering to the hydraulic constraints of OCIS. This study marks a first step toward utilizing intelligent agents in critical areas such as irrigation water management. Future work will focus on enhancing the R3 DT to increase the agent's robustness, enabling it to generate reliable recommendations for real-world applications.},

   abstract = {A reliable estimate of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) requires several meteorological inputs, which may be unavailable in regions with limited data availability. In this regard, this study aimed to address the following objectives: First, to evaluate the effectiveness of ERA5_Land (ERA5_L hereafter) weather forecasts in providing daily agrometeorological variables for the period 2003–2021 at 10 study sites distributed over both plain and mountainous areas in a North African basin. Second, to investigate whether downscaling the ERA5_L data (10 km) to station scale (250 m) using a quasi-physical based model, MicroMet, could improve the reliability of the meteorological variables. Third, to compare the performance of the original ERA5_L reanalysis data and the disaggregated ERA5_L data (MicroMet) as potential sources for accurate estimation of ET0 on a daily time scale. Finally, to assess the long-term spatiotemporal changes in ET0 across the Tensift basin over the period 1950–2021, and the influence of climate variables and topography on ET0 variability. The findings of the study revealed that the original ERA5_L estimates of air temperature (Tair) were the most accurate among the studied variables, followed by solar radiation (Rs), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (u2). When considering the disaggregated daily ERA5_L data, Tair exhibited the highest performance, followed by RH, u2, and Rs. Tair and especially u2 demonstrated an improvement across the plain and mountainous sites. However, Rs was generally degraded after MicroMet. Then, a comparison was conducted between daily ET0 obtained considering both datasets and show similar correlations between ground and simulated data but with an overestimation of ET0 after MicroMet. Finally, the retrospective analysis of ET0 showed three main phases with a decrease of ET0 between 1950 and 1970, a nearly steady period during 1970–2000, and a significant increase from 2000 to 2021. This study provides a comprehensive insight on the potential and limitations of ERA5_L products in arid North African regarding irrigation and water management under climate variability.},

   abstract = {In the face of advancements in data-driven approaches, specifically artificial intelligence (AI) models, concerns are raised about the future of traditional empirical modeling. AI-driven models proved to be more effective in learning complex patterns while being easy to implement, data- and computationally efficient. From an environmental science perspective, where these challenges are significant, this study evaluates machine learning and empirical modeling for two tasks: (i) reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimation and (ii) relative humidity (RH) estimation. The study is conducted using data sourced from two automatic weather stations (AWSs) located in two agricultural flat regions: R3, in Morocco and Davis, in California, United States. The in-situ data includes air temperature (Ta) and RH. Additionally, dew point temperature (Td) data were sourced from the Copernicus ERA5-Land Reanalysis product, and daily extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) was estimated based on latitude and the day of the year. The study compared the empirical models Hargreaves-Samani (HS) and Magnus formula, two established and extensively used as a subcomponent in various environmental science modeling software, versus the CatBoost ensemble machine learning model in predicting daily ETo and hourly RH. CatBoost was fed and trained on the same input parameters used in the empirical models to (i) predict ETo given Ta and Ra and (ii) predict RH given Ta and Td. The output was then compared to Penman-Monteith ETo and in-situ RH for the two scenarios, respectively. The results show that CatBoost outperformed HS and Magnus. For ETo, CatBoost had an RMSE of 0.01 and 0.18 mm.day-1, while HS had 0.57 and 0.89 mm.day-1 for R3 and Davis, respectively. Similarly, for RH, CatBoost surpassed Magnus in all metrics, specifically evident in the RMSE values of 6.99 and 9.18% versus 11.02 and 12.93%, for R3 and Davis, respectively. While the study confirms the assumption that AI-driven modeling is here to stay, questions about stochasticity, explainability, adherence to physics-ground truth, and reliability should be further investigated.},

   abstract = {Collaborative approaches have proven effective in addressing complex problems, from human and socioeconomic challenges to multi-agent systems. These methods rely on the principle that combining perspectives enhances problem-solving. In this paper, we propose a collaborative large language models (LLM) framework to solve Islamic inheritance problems , which demand precise mathematical reasoning and strict adherence to legal rules for fair distribution among heirs. The system implements a collaborative voting mechanism involving multiple LLMs, namely ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, Deepseek-reasoner, and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Each independently answered multiple-choice inheritance questions. The final answer is determined by majority vote. To improve accuracy and domain grounding, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A curated database of solved inheritance cases in JSON format is indexed using TF-IDF. For each query, the most similar cases are retrieved and appended as contextual information to the prompt before being submitted to the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that this collaborative RAG-enhanced framework outperforms individual LLMs. The ensemble achieved 88% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing single models: the fine-tuned ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview (79.50%), Deepeek-reasoner (71.80%), and Gemini-2.5-Flash (83.50%).},

   abstract = {As precision agriculture (PA) advances, the demand for accurate and high-resolution weather forecasts becomes critical for optimizing agricultural management practices. Despite improvements in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they lack the granularity and efficiency needed for PA. Data-driven models offer a promising alternative by integrating predictive capabilities closer to IoT edge data sources, but their efficacy requires evaluation. Here, this paper evaluates six models from three data-driven eras (statistical, machine learning, and deep learning) using agrometeorological data from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) in Sidi Rahal, East Marrakech, central Morocco, covering 2013–2020 at half-hour intervals, including air temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity. First, the data is quality-controlled through imputation using ERA5-Land. Then, the dataset was split into training (2013–2019) and evaluation (2020) sets, with validation horizons of 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week. Statistical models generally perform well in air temperature forecasting, occasionally surpassing other models. However, the Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN) consistently demonstrates superior performance for challenging variables, balancing low RMSE and high R2 across various horizons, with some exceptions. Specifically, for relative humidity, the linear regression model achieves slightly lower RMSE (3,96% and 6,05%) compared to TCNN (4,00% and 6,79%) for 1 day and 3 days, respectively. Additionally, CatBoost outperforms TCNN for 1-week forecasts. In terms of training time, the Transformer requires the longest, followed by AutoARIMA and CatBoost. Uncertainty analysis of stochastic models using solar radiation showed the stable performance of TCNN with 0,80 and 0,01 for the RMSE and R2 standard deviations, respectively. Considering the trade-off between performance, training time, and capturing complex relationships, TCNN emerges as the optimal choice. ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests also confirmed TCNN’s performance. Finally, a comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) reveals TCNN’s clear superiority in all metrics, particularly evident for the RMSE of 3 days air temperature forecasts (TCNN: 1,96 °C, GFS: 3,59 °C).},

   abstract = {Numerical methods represent a powerful tool for weather forecasting. However, they still face various limitations related to energy consumption and the time it takes to run simulations. To overcome these weaknesses, various statistical and deep learning models were developed to combine precision, time, and energy efficiency criteria. In this paper, we evaluated models of both classes for the task of short-term weather forecasting (one day, three days, and one-week forecasts), namely, the autoregressive integrated moving average, the theta method, and fast Fourier transform as statistical models, versus a long short-term memory, neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series, and temporal convolutional neural network as deep learning architectures. The dataset used in this study is sourced from the automatic meteorological station installed in the Marrakech region (center of Morocco) covering the period from January 3, 2013, to December 31, 2020, on a half-hour scale. These include air temperature (Ta), air relative humidity (Hr), and global solar radiation (Rg). Before feeding the data to our models, we first used the ERA5-Land Reanalysis data to impute missing values found in our time series. Results show that the TCNN model outperforms the others in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE).},

   abstract = {Accurately estimating latent heat flux (LE) is crucial for achieving efficiency in irrigation. It is a fundamental component in determining the actual evapotranspiration (ETa), which in turn, quantifies the amount of water lost that needs to be adequately compensated through irrigation. Empirical and physics-based models have extensive input data and site-specific limitations when estimating the LE. In contrast, the emergence of data-driven techniques combined with remote sensing has shown promising results for LE estimation with minimal and easy-to-obtain input data. This paper evaluates two machine learning-based approaches for estimating the LE. The first uses climate data, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST), while the second uses climate data combined with raw satellite bands. In-situ data were sourced from a flux station installed in our study area. The data include air temperatures (Ta), global solar radiation (Rg), and measured LE for the period 2015-2018. The study uses Landsat 8 as a remote sensing data source. At first, 12 raw available bands were downloaded. The LST is then derived from thermal bands using the Split Window algorithm (SW) and the NDVI from optical bands. During machine learning modeling, the CatBoost model is fed, trained, and evaluated using the two data combination approaches. Cross-validation of 3-folds gave an average RMSE of 27.54 W.nr2 using the first approach and 27.05 W.nr2 using the second approach. Results raise the question: Do we need additional computational layers when working with remote sensing products combined with machine learning? Future work is to generalize the approach and test it for other applications such as soil moisture retrieval, and yield prediction.},

To this end, this paper presents a smart weather data management system composed of three layers: the data acquisition layer, the data storage layer, and the application layer. The data can be sourced from station sensors, real-time IoT sensors, third-party services (APIs), or manually imported from files. It is then checked for errors and missing values before being stored using the distributed database MongoDB. The platform provides various services related to weather data: (i) forecast univariate weather time series, (ii) perform advanced analysis and visualization, (iii) use machine learning to estimate and model important climatic parameters such as the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) estimation using the XGBoost model (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.39).

   abstract = {Statistical models predict that the world's population will reach 8.5 billion by the end of 2030. This represents a real threat to our food security and puts the current food production system under pressure. Efficient use of Earth's natural resources is the only solution to facing future challenges such as global hunger. The implementation of precision agriculture using new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, IoT and remote sensing is the first step towards this goal. In this paper, we investigated several machine learning models to create two services: one for recommending the best crop to grow based on soil and the region's weather characteristics, and another for the forecasting of the hourly average air temperature. Performance evaluation results for the first service show that Random Forest has the best metrics as a classifier (accuracy = 100%, precision = 100%, recall = 100%) compared to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Feed Forward Neural Network. This is a confirmation that classic machine learning algorithms perform better on small-size datasets. In our case, we used a dataset of 2200 instances available online. On the other hand, Facebook Prophet was more accurate (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 3.74) than our proposed LSTM architecture in time series forecasting at hourly scale using historical weather data provided by the weather station of our study area. These two optimal models are then integrated as the first building blocks in our decision support platform, intended for both farmers and policymakers with the aim of making agriculture in Morocco more efficient and more sustainable.},

   abstract = {In mountainous regions, the scarcity of air temperature (Ta) measurements is a major limitation for hydrological and crop monitoring. An alternative to in situ measurements could be to downscale the reanalysis Ta data provided at high-temporal resolution. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolution of these products (i.e., 9 km for ERA5-Land) is unlikely to be directly representative of actual local Ta patterns. To address this issue, this study presents a new spatial downscaling strategy of hourly ERA5-Land Ta data with a three-step procedure. First, the 9 km resolution ERA5 Ta is corrected at its original resolution by using a reference Ta derived from the elevation of the 9 km resolution grid and an in situ estimate over the area of the hourly Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR). Such a correction of 9 km resolution ERA5 Ta is trained using several machine learning techniques, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost), as well as ancillary ERA5 data (daily mean, standard deviation, hourly ELR, and grid elevation). Next, the trained correction algorithms are run to correct 9 km resolution ERA5 Ta, and the corrected ERA5 Ta data are used to derive an updated ELR over the area (without using in situ Ta measurements). Third, the updated hourly ELR is used to disaggregate 9 km resolution corrected ERA5 Ta data at the 30-meter resolution of SRTM’s Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The effectiveness of this method is assessed across the northern part of the High Atlas Mountains in central Morocco through (1) k-fold cross-validation against five years (2016 to 2020) of in situ hourly temperature readings and (2) comparison with classical downscaling methods based on a constant ELR. Our results indicate a significant enhancement in the spatial distribution of hourly local Ta. By comparing our model, which included Xgboost, SVR, and MLR, with the constant ELR-based downscaling approach, we were able to decrease the regional root mean square error from approximately 3 ∘C to 1.61 ∘C, 1.75 ∘C, and 1.8 ∘C, reduce the mean bias error from −0.5 ∘C to null, and increase the coefficient of determination from 0.88 to 0.97, 0.96, and 0.96 for Xgboost, SVR, and MLR, respectively.},

   abstract = {Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) is a key parameter in hydrology. It has a variety of practical applications, ranging from understanding the hydrological cycle to estimating crop water needs for efficient irrigation in agriculture. The FAO PENMAN–MONTEITH (FAO-PM) method is largely adopted and is the recommended method by the FAO for ET0 estimation. However, it requires multiple measured meteorological parameters that are, in some conditions, difficult to obtain. This work fills this gap and leverages the potential of data-driven methods, namely machine learning and deep learning models, to accurately estimate ET0 while using a limited number of easy-to-obtain parameters. The study uses physical-based models (FAO-PM and Hargreaves) as ET0 learning data providers for data-driven models. First, physical models were fed with meteorological data covering the period 2013–2020 at an hourly scale to estimate ET0. The data were sourced from the in-situ local weather station of our study area in the Tensift basin (center of Morocco) and from the Copernicus ERA5-Land reanalysis data. Next, as a preprocessing step, feature engineering was performed using a decision tree-based approach. We evaluated the predictive importance of weather parameters for ET0 estimation. Scores between 0 and 1 were assigned to each parameter, indicating their efficacy. Notably, mean air temperature and global solar radiation stood out, collectively surpassing an 86% importance threshold. In contrast to the rest of the parameters that have a low importance of 10%. This emphasizes the critical significance of mean air temperature and global solar radiation as essential predictors for accurate ET0 estimation. Finally, during the modeling phase, three deep-learning models Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit, and Convolutional Neural Network are highlighted. Notably, the LSTM model exhibits superior performance, delivering comparable coefficients of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) results, surpassing its counterparts. In terms of univariate predictions using the Hargreaves and FAO-56 PM methods, the LSTM consistently achieves high R2 values of 0.90 across all data sources, accompanied by impressive accuracy reflected in low MAE, MSE, and RMSE values ranging from 0.004 to 0.07 mm/day. In addition, the ensemble learning model XGBoost had the best prediction performance with R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 0.03 mm/day. This confirms that machine learning models outperform deep learning architectures for small and medium-sized datasets. The proposed models will be integrated into an under-development agricultural decision support system.},

   abstract = {Clean weather time series is the primary ingredient for the successful modeling of any process in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. However, measured meteorological data are often associated with gaps due to various reasons, such as eventual sensor malfunctioning, power outages, and data transmission errors. Thus, meteorological data needs to be quality-controlled prior to any further processing. To this end, we developed a Python framework that automatically detects missing values and uses ERA5-Land reanalysis data and machine learning to fill in the gaps. The resulting RMSE values indicate a good consistency between the estimated and real in-situ data (0.73 °C, 26.07 W m2, and 11.57%, for air temperature, global solar radiation, and air relative humidity, respectively.). Additionally, the framework implements different data-driven methods to detect and fill in outliers and apply physics constraints to the data.},

   abstract = {Smart management of weather data is an essential step toward implementing sustainability and precision in agriculture. It represents an important input for numerous tasks, such as crop growth, development, yield, and irrigation scheduling, to name a few. Advances in technology allow collecting this weather data from heterogeneous sources with high temporal resolution and at low cost. Generating and using these data in their raw form makes no sense, and therefore implementing adequate infrastructure and tools is necessary. For that purpose, this paper presents a smart weather data management system evaluated using data from a meteorological station installed in our study area covering the period from 2013 to 2020 at a half-hourly scale. The proposed system makes use of state-of-the-art statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning models to derive actionable insights from these raw data. The general architecture is made up of four layers: data acquisition, data storage, data processing, and application layers. The data sources include real-time sensors, IoT devices, reanalysis data, and raw files. The data are then checked for errors and missing values using a proposed method based on ERA5-Land reanalysis data and deep learning. The resulting coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for this method were 0.96 and 0.04, respectively, for the scaled air temperature estimate. The MongoDB NoSQL database is used for storage thanks to its ability to deal with real-world big data. The system offers various services such as (i) weather time series forecasts, (ii) visualization and analysis of meteorological data, and (iii) the use of machine learning to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) needed for efficient irrigation. To this, the platform uses the XGBoost model to achieve the precision of the Penman–Monteith method while using a limited number of meteorological variables (air temperature and global solar radiation). Results for this approach give R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.07. This system represents the first incremental step toward implementing smart and sustainable agriculture in Morocco.},

   abstract = {Due to population growth and the effects of climate change, most of the world's regions are threatened by water scarcity, especially in Africa and the Mediterranean region. In Morocco, agriculture consumes more than 85% of available water. Thus, to preserve water resources, the rational management of irrigation water is necessary. In this context, recent technological progress and the emergence of artificial intelligence could provide an effective decision support tool for the rational and sustainable use of this resource. In this paper, we propose an approach based on reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning that uses the trial-and-error principle to learn how to best fit the situation to action in a highly dynamic, stochastic environment. In this proposed approach, a Farmer Agent learns to choose the optimal cropping pattern defined by the type of crop, area to cultivate, sowing date, and irrigation plan depending on the water availability at the beginning of the agricultural season. Each agent interacts with the environment which is composed of environmental and socio-economic modules containing different processes to provide the Farmer Agent with the information he needs to learn. The use of reinforcement learning in this complex system will certainly change the traditional irrigation water management mode and bring more intelligence into the system. This approach will be generalized in future work to cover the entire agricultural sector and study the behavior of many Farmer Agents. This will be used then, for the design and implementation of a decision support system platform that can be used at the beginning of the agricultural season to make informed decisions.},

   abstract = {Assessing the right amount of water needs for a specific crop is a key task for farmers and agronomists to achieve efficient and optimal irrigation scheduling, and then an optimal crop yield. To this end, the reference evapotranspiration (ET 0 ) was developed. It represents the atmospheric evaporation demand, and therefore an important variable for irrigation management. In this regard, several methods such as the FAO’s Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves have been used to model and estimate ET 0 . These methods use climatic parameters data for calculation procedures such as solar net radiation (R n ), saturation vapour pressure(e s ), and min-max air temperatures or a combination of them. In this paper, we investigated two proposed data-driven methods to predict ET 0 values in a semi-arid region in Morocco. The first approach is based on forecasting techniques and the second one uses end-to-end modeling of ET 0 based on meteorological data and machine learning models. The feature selection and engineering results show that solar global radiation (R g ) and mean air temperature (T a ) have a significance of more than 87% as relevant predictors features for the ET 0 . We then used them as input to machine learning regression models. Regression evaluation metrics showed that The XGboost regressor model performs well in both cross-validation with R 2 =0.93 in the first fold, and in hold-out validation with R 2 =0.92 and RMSE=0.55. As a final step, we compared the univariate time series forecasting of ET 0 using the Facebook Prophet model versus the machine learning modeling method that we proposed. As goodness-of-fit measures, forecasting using machine learning modeling of ET 0 showed better results in terms of both R 2 and RMSE.},

   abstract = {With the growing demand for water resources, the need for monitoring has become a necessity for rational and sustainable use of this resource. Water meter data collection is an essential step toward this goal. In Morocco, this task is performed manually at most once a month due to constraints related to the cost and time. In general, the consumption is estimated and calculated based on the average consumption recorded in the previous months. This causes many claims from customers because of higher invoices, which does not reflect reality. In this paper, we propose a fully AI-based system to automate water meter data collection, which is composed of a Recognition System (RS) and a web services platform. This framework offers multiple services for both customers and water service providers, such as consumption monitoring, detecting water leaks, visualizing water consumption, and potable water coverage in a geographic map. It also provides a powerful tool to help ensure accurate decision making with multiple reporting services. The main component of the RS is the Convolutional Neural Network model trained on a proposed MR-AMR (Moroccan Automatic Meter Reading) dataset. In the model test phase, we achieved an accuracy of 98.70%. Our system was tested and validated by experiments.},

The customer remotely launches an online command to pick up the meter index, then an image is taken from meter index in order to be processed and finally send the result to the customer. In the Automatic Meter Reading literature, a few datasets are available to the research community. In this sense, we introduce a new public dataset, called MR-AMR dataset (Moroccan AMR), with more than 15000 images.
